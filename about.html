  <h2>Why Coloring is Awesome</h2>
  <p class="text-center lead" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
    Coloring isn't just fun—it's good for your brain too! Here are some cool things that happen when you color:
  </p>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Boosts Creativity</h3>
      <p>Coloring helps you think of new ideas and see the world in different ways. It's like a workout for your imagination!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Helps You Focus</h3>
      <p>When you focus on coloring inside the lines (or outside!), it helps you get better at paying attention. That's a super skill for school!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Improves Hand Skills</h3>
      <p>Using a mouse or your finger to color helps make your hands stronger and more coordinated. It's great practice for writing and drawing!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Makes You Happy</h3>
      <p>Coloring is a calm and happy activity. Finishing a picture you love can make you feel proud and relaxed.</p>
